#Currency converter#
Currency converter is a simple application that helps you convert from a currency to another. You can update the exchange rates everytime you want so you'll have always an up-to-date conversion. Once retrieved, the rates are saved so the user can use the application offline.

This application is written using HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the support of several frameworks like jQuery, jQuery Mobile and Cordova (also known as PhoneGap).

##Compilation##
[Currency converter](https://github.com/AurelioDeRosa/Currency-Converter) has been developed with the assumption that the compilation will be done using [Adobe PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com/), but with few adjustments you'll be able to compile with every platform specific environment.

##Compatibility##
Being a Cordova based application, it can run on all the platform supported by the framework. To have a complete list of the operating systems supported, take a look at [official documentation page](http://phonegap.com/about/feature).
